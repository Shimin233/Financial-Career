## Download
Following instruction [here](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/README.md), summarise the useful steps: 
(Can see Terminal file in shiminfu/Desktop/CareerPreparation)
Open Terminal, type (then press return/enter, same as below)
```
python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
```
since I have Python3 (while Python2 is also there) but seems not to have pip, 
I use this to install pip according to [pip document](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

Then type 
```
pip install notebook
```
to install Jupyter notebook. 

Run Jupyter notebook by typing
```
jupyter notebook
```
Then I am automatically directed to a webpage of Jupyter notebook, with address being `http://localhost:8888/tree`.
