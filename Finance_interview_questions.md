## Warmup: Finance interview questions and Answers

- __Financial modeling__: the process of creating a summary of a company's expenses and earnings, in the form of a spreadsheet   
that can be used to calculate the impact of a future event or decision\

- Weighted average cost of capital(__WACC__): a calculation of a firm's cost of capital in which each 
category of capital is proportinately weighted. 

WACC = (E/V) * Re  + (D/V) * Rd * (1-Tc)\
where 
E=Market value of the firm's equity, \
D=Market value of the firm's debt, \
V=E+D, \
Re=cost of equity, Rd=cost of debt, \
Tc=corporate tax rate. \
Weighted value of equity-linked capital=(E/V) * Re, \
weighted value of debt-linked capital=(D/V) * Rd * (1-Tc). \

WACC inc <-> beta (volatility of a stock, i.e. both risk and return) and rate of return on equity inc
<-> valuation dec and risk inc (remember WACC is a 'cost')\

- 'Build a cash flow (statement)' from an income statement:
- __Income statement__ (profit and loss statement / statement of revenue and expense): one of the three important financial statements, used for reporting a company's financial performace   over a 
specific accounting period. \
  The other two key statements are the __balance sheet__, and the __statement of cash flows__. 
  - four key items:
    - revenue
      - operating revenue: the revenue realised via primary activities (e.g. sale of product for a wholesaler)
      - non-operting revenue: the revenue realised via secondary, non-core business activities (e.g. interest income earned on business capital lying in the bank)
    - gains (aka other income): net income from sale of long-term assets), incl. net money made from one-time non-business activities, e.g. unused land, a subsidiary company
      - Note: tell revenue from receipt (cash accounted for when money is actually received)
    - expenses
      - primary activity expenses: incl. cost of goods sold (COGS), selling, and general administrative expenses (SG&A), depreciation or amortisation (the systematic repayment of a debt), research and development (R&D) expenses, emplyee wages
      - secondary activity expenses: all expenses linked to non-core business activities, e.g. interests paid on loan money
    - losses (as expenses): all expenses that go to a loss-making sale of long-term assets, one-time or any other un-usual costs, or expenses towards lawsuits 
      - e.g.++++++++++++++\

-  __Statement of cash flows__ (cash flow statement, CFS): provides aggregate data regarding all _cash inflows_ that a company reveices from its ongoing operations and external investment sources, and all _cash outflows_ that pay for business activities and investments during a given period. \
  - a bridge between income statement and balance sheet, via showing how money moves in and out
  - measures how well a company manages its cash position -> how well it generates cash to pay its debt obligations and fund its operating expenses
  - most intuitive of all the financial statements: follows the cash made by the business in 3 ways/sections: 
    - operations, investment, and financing
    - sum of these three = _net cash flow_
    - these 3 sections help determine the value of a company's stock, or of the whole company
  - section 1, cash flow from operations(CFO / operating cash flow, OCF): transactions from all operational business activities. e.g. buying&selling inventory and supplies, paying emplyees salaries; excl. investments, debts, dividends
  - section 2, cash flow from investment(CFI / ICF): the result of investment gains and losses, and cash spent on property, plant, equipment(PP&E)
    - look at this section for changes in _capital expenditures (CapEx)_ (CapEx = cash spent on purchasing PP&E, inc -> cash flow dec, maybe -> invest for future and firm growing)
  - section 3, cash flow from financing (CFF): overview of cash used from debt and equity, measures cash flow between a company and its owners/creditors
    -  CFF>0 -> more money coming into than out; CFO<0, company is paying off debt/ making devidend payments and/or stock buybacks (a company pays shareholders the market value per share, to re-absorb ownerships of it from investors) 
  - (sometimes) section 4, disclosure of non-cash activities, may be included under the generally accepted accounting principles ([GAAP](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp), a combination of authoritative standards set by policy boards and the commonly accepted ways of recording and reporting accounting information)
  - Two methods of calculating/presenting CFS are the direct and indirect methods, with their difference only in CFO. Because not all transactions involve actual cash items, many items have to be re-evaluated when calculating CFO from income statement and balance sheet
    - direct method (preferred by International Accounting Standards Board, [IASB](https://www.iasplus.com/en/resources/ifrsf/iasb-ifrs-ic/iasb)): adds up all the types of cash payments and receipts, e.g. cash paid to suppliers, cash paid for capital expenditures (out), cash receipts from customers (in), cash paid out in salaries, which are calculated by beginning and ending balances of business accounts
    - indirect method (more common than direct method; __linking income statement to CFS__): CFO is calculated by taking the <u>net income</u> (rather than revenue) off of the income statement, then adjust _earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)_ for items that affect net income (though no actual cash has yet been received or paid), add back non-operating activities that don't affect CFO (e.g. depreciation, not a cash expense, not affecting net income, but only an amount dedeucted from the previous total asset value, so added back net earnings)
      - summary for indirect method from [CFI-Cash Flow Classifications](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/statement-of-cash-flows/): Profit P -> amortisation A, Impairment expense I, Change in working capital ΔWC，Change in provisions ΔP, Interest Tax (I), Tax (T) -> CFO. Note that the items in the CFS are not all actual cash flows, but __'reasons why cash flow is different from profit'__ ++eg++++++++++. Profit used here can be net income, proft before/after tax, etc.
      - Tip: the only time when the income from an asset is accounted for in CFS, is when the asset is sold
    - See eg for direct VS indirect methods, from [CFI](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/statement-of-cash-flows/): ![CFI-DirectVSIndirect](CFI-DirectVSIndirect,png)
    - Others that may be used in CFO: 
    - Accounts Receivable (AR): on the balance sheet, from one accounting period to the next. AR dec -> cash entering into company from customers paying off their credit accounts -> #AR dec = #inc to net earnings\
    - Inventory Value: #inventory(purchased in cash) inc -> company spends more to buy raw materials => #net earnings dec; #inventory(purchased on credit) inc -> #accounts payable inc (on balance sheet) & #net earnings from one year to the other inc +++++++++++++++++eg
    - Taxes payable, salaries payable, prepaid insurance, etc.: similar to Inventory value: #sth. paid off => #valued owed from one year to the next dec in net income\

- Net present value(__NPV__)(https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp)

- XNPV is a function in Excel (https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/102715/calculating-npv-and-xnpv-formulas-using-excel.asp)

- difference? (https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/npv-vs-xnpv/)
The answer is simple. NPV assumes that future cash inflows happen at the end of the year (from today). ... However, when we calculated the present value using XNPV, the cash inflow dates were the actual year-end dates. When we use XNPV, we are discounting the first cash flow for a period that is less than one year.
