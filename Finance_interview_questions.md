- Weighted average cost of capital(__WACC__): a calculation of a firm's cost of capital in which each 
category of capital is proportinately weighted. 

WACC = (E * Re /V) + (D * Rd * (1-Tc)/V ), \
where
E=Market value of the firm's equity, \
D=Market value of the firm's debt, \
V=E+D, \
Re=cost of equity, \Rd=cost of debt, \
Tc=corporate tax rate. \
Weighted value of equity-linked capital=(E/V) * Re, \
weighted value of debt-linked capital=(D/V) * Rd * (1-Tc). \

WACC inc <-> beta (volatility of a stock, i.e. both risk and return) and rate of retuen on equity inc
<-> valuation dec and risk inc (remember WACC is a 'cost')\
