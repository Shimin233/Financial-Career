- __Financial modeling__: the process of creating a summary of a company's expenses and earnings, in the form of a spreadsheet   
that can be used to calculate the impact of a future event or decision\

- Weighted average cost of capital(__WACC__): a calculation of a firm's cost of capital in which each 
category of capital is proportinately weighted. 

WACC = (E/V) * Re  + (D/V) * Rd * (1-Tc)\
where 
E=Market value of the firm's equity, \
D=Market value of the firm's debt, \
V=E+D, \
Re=cost of equity, Rd=cost of debt, \
Tc=corporate tax rate. \
Weighted value of equity-linked capital=(E/V) * Re, \
weighted value of debt-linked capital=(D/V) * Rd * (1-Tc). \

WACC inc <-> beta (volatility of a stock, i.e. both risk and return) and rate of return on equity inc
<-> valuation dec and risk inc (remember WACC is a 'cost')\

- 'Build a cash flow (statement)' from an income statement:
- __Income statement__ (profit and loss statement / statement of revenue and expense): one of the three important financial statements, used for reporting a company's financial performace   over a 
specific accounting period. \
  The other two key statements are the __balance sheet__, and the __statement of cash flows__. 
  - four key items:
    - revenue
      - operating revenue: the revenue realised via primary activities (e.g. sale of product for a wholesaler)
      - non-operting revenue: the revenue realised via secondary, non-core business activities (e.g. interest income earned on business capital lying in the bank)
    - gains (aka other income): net income from sale of long-term assets), incl. net money made from one-time non-business activities, e.g. unused land, a subsidiary company
      - Note: tell revenue from receipt (cash accounted for when money is actually received)
    - expenses
      - primary activity expenses: incl. cost of goods sold (COGS), selling, and general administrative expenses (SG&A), depreciation or amortisation (the systematic repayment of a debt), research and development (R&D) expenses, emplyee wages
      - secondary activity expenses: all expenses linked to non-core business activities, e.g. interests paid on loan money
    - losses (as expenses): all expenses that go to a loss-making sale of long-term assets, one-time or any other un-usual costs, or expenses towards lawsuits 
      - e.g.++++++++++++++\

-  __Statement of cash flows__ (cash flow statement, CFS): provides aggregate data regarding all _cash inflows_ that a company reveices from its ongoing operations and external investment sources, and all _cash outflows_ that pay for business activities and investments during a given period. \
  - a bridge between income statement and balance sheet, via showing how money moves in and out
  - measures how well a company manages its cash position -> how well it generates cash to pay its debt obligations and fund its operating expenses
  - most intuitive of all the financial statements: follows the cash made by the business in 3 ways/sections: 
    - operations, investment, and financing
    - sum of these three = _net cash flow_
    - these 3 sections help determine the value of a company's stock, or of the whole company
  - section 1, cash flow from operations(CFO / operating cash flow, OCF): transactions from all operational business activities. e.g. buying&selling inventory and supplies, paying emplyees salaries; excl. investments, debts, dividends
  - section 2, cash flow from investment(CFI / ICF): the result of investment gains and losses, and cash spent on property, plant, equipment(PP&E)
    - look at this section for changes in _capital expenditures (CapEx)_ (CapEx = cash spent on purchasing PP&E, inc -> cash flow dec, maybe -> invest for future and firm growing)
  - section 3, cash flow from financing (CFF): overview of cash used from debt and equity, measures cash flow between a company and its owners/creditors
    -  CFF>0 -> more money coming into than out; CFO<0, company is paying off debt/ making devidend payments and/or stock buybacks (a company pays shareholders the market value per share, to re-absorb ownerships of it from investors) 
  - (sometimes) section 4, disclosure of non-cash activities, may be included under the generally accepted accounting principles ([GAAP](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp), a combination of authoritative standards set by policy boards and the commonly accepted ways of recording and reporting accounting information)
  - Two methods of calculating/presenting CFS are the direct and indirect methods, with their difference only in CFO. Because not all transactions involve actual cash items, many items have to be re-evaluated when calculating CFO from income statement and balance sheet
    - direct method (preferred by International Accounting Standards Board, [IASB](https://www.iasplus.com/en/resources/ifrsf/iasb-ifrs-ic/iasb)): adds up all the types of cash payments and receipts, e.g. cash paid to suppliers, cash paid for capital expenditures (out), cash receipts from customers (in), cash paid out in salaries, which are calculated by beginning and ending balances of business accounts
    - indirect method (more common than direct method; __linking income statement to CFS__): CFO is calculated by taking the <u>net income</u> (rather than revenue) off of the income statement, then adjust _earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)_ for items that affect net income (though no actual cash has yet been received or paid), add back non-operating activities that don't affect CFO (e.g. depreciation, not a cash expense, not affecting net income, but only an amount dedeucted from the previous total asset value, so added back net earnings)
      - summary for indirect method from [CFI-Cash Flow Classifications](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/statement-of-cash-flows/): Profit P -> amortisation A, Impairment expense I, Change in working capital ΔWC，Change in provisions ΔP, Interest Tax (I), Tax (T) -> CFO. Note that the items in the CFS are not all actual cash flows, but __'reasons why cash flow is different from profit'__ ++eg++++++++++. Profit used here can be net income, proft before/after tax, etc.
      - Tip: the only time when the income from an asset is accounted for in CFS, is when the asset is sold
    - See eg for direct VS indirect methods, from [CFI](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/statement-of-cash-flows/): ![CFI-DirectVSIndirect](CFI-DirectVSIndirect,png)
    - Others that may be used in CFO: 
    - Accounts Receivable (AR): on the balance sheet, from one accounting period to the next. AR dec -> cash entering into company from customers paying off their credit accounts -> #AR dec = #inc to net earnings\
    - Inventory Value: #inventory(purchased in cash) inc -> company spends more to buy raw materials => #net earnings dec; #inventory(purchased on credit) inc -> #accounts payable inc (on balance sheet) & #net earnings from one year to the other inc +++++++++++++++++eg
    - Taxes payable, salaries payable, prepaid insurance, etc.: similar to Inventory value: #sth. paid off => #valued owed from one year to the next dec in net income\

- Net present value(__NPV__): difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows, over a period of time. It is used to calculate the current total value of a future stream of payments
  - NPV > 0 -> discounted present value of all future cash flows will be positive, thus attractive
  - calculation of NPV: estimate the future net cash flows (inflow-outflow) for each period t, R_t and determine the correct discount rate of return i (that can be earned in alternative investments, if the money not used in curremt way), 
  NPV = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{R_t}{(1+i)^t}
  NPV = TVECF - TVIC, \
  where TVECF = today's value of the expected cash flows = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{Inflow_t}{(1+i)^t}, \
  TVIC = today's value of invested cash = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{Outflow_t}{(1+i)^t}\
  - Also a function in Excel
(Source: [Net Present Value (NPV)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp)
- XNPV, is the NPV for a range of cash payments that need not be essentially periodic, but we know the exact dates of payments; is also a function in Excel (https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/102715/calculating-npv-and-xnpv-formulas-using-excel.asp)

- difference? 
  NPV = \sum_{t=1}^{n}\frac{C_{it}}{(1+r)^t} - X_0
  XNPV = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{P_t}{(1+r)^((d_t-d_0)/365)} 
where X_0 = net initial expenditures, \
r=discount rate, \
C_{it} = inflow at period t, \
d_t = the t-th payment date, \
d_0 = the 0-th payment date, (assuming the whole period is 365-day\
P_t = the payment at period t. \

- Definition of short/long-term financing ([source](https://www.fundera.com/business-loans/guides/short-term-finance)): Financing that extends for longer than a 18-month period is typically referred to as LONG-TERM FINANCING, while financing that extends over a period from 30 days to 18 months (same as short term debt? which is usually within 1 year on [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shorttermdebt.asp)) is typically referred to as SHORT-TERM FINANCING. 
- (different from given answer!++++++) Short-term financing: its main sources are
  1. __trade credit__ (1st important source, the largest single category of short-term credit): credit terms are usually with a cash discount for prompt payment of debt (due to purchase of a company's supplies and materials, recorded as an _account payable_). Cost of not taking the cash discount = price of credit. e.g.disconut = 2% off, price= 98% * total debt +++++++confirm this eg++++++++
  2. __commercial bank loans__ (2nd important): appears on the balance sheet as _notes payable_. A bank provides (a) a single loan to a firm, and the firm signs a promissory note 期票，欠票; repayment is mad in a lump sum at maturity (date), or in intallments throughout the life of the loan; (b) a line of credit, which is a formal/informal understanding between the bank and the borrower, as to the max loan balance that the bank will allow at any one time. 
  3. __commercial paper__, a specific type of promissory note: a basic limitation of it is that its resources are limited to the excess liquidity
  4. __secured loans__ in contrary, most short-term business loans are unsecured (an established company’s credit rating qualifies it for a loan)

- Macauley v.s. Modified Duration, both are used to calculate the duration of bonds, while they are different: 
  - Macauley duration: calculates the _weighted average time_ before a bondholder would receive the bond's cash flows
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math\text{Macauley duration} = \frac{ {\sum_{t=1}^{n} t * C * (1 + y)^{-t}} + n * M * (1 + y)^{-n}}{\text{current bond price}}">

   Macauley duration = \[ \sum_{t=1}^{n} t * C * (1+y)^{-t} + n * M * (1+y)^{-n} \] / {current bond price},\
   where C = periodic coupon payment, \
   y = periodic yield, \
   M = the bond's maturity value, \
   n = duration of bonds in periods
  - Modified duration: measures the price sensitivity of a bond when there is a change in the yield to maturity
   Modified duration = \frac{Macauley duration}{1 + YTM/n}, \
   where YTM = yield to maturity, n = #coupon periods per year
 +++++++need more materials /eg to understand this+++++++++++++

- Deferred Tax Liability: a tax that is assessed/due for the current period, but not yet been paid. 'Deferred' comes from the difference in timing between when the tax is accrued (thus should be recorded) and when it is paid.
  - e.g. the difference in depreciation expense treatment by tax laws and accounting rules 
  - e.g. installment sale: the revenue is recognised when a company sells its product on credit to be paid off in equal amounts in the future. Accounting rule allows company to recognise full income, while tax laws require them to recognise income when installment payments are made 

|              e.g.              |          Accounting rules      |                   Tax laws             | Difference between...and ..., thus a deferred tax liability|
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Depreciation expense treatment |staightline-method(lower depreci) |   accelerated depreciation method  |  accounting income > taxable income|
|         Installment sale       |recognise full income |income when installment payments are made |accounting earnings > taxable income|

  +++++++come back to understand e.g.'s better++++maybe a table is needed++\

- Negative Working Capital:
- Working capital (net working capital, __NWC__): the difference between a company's _(operating) current assets_ (available within 12 months; e.g. cash, accounts receivable (customers' unpaid bills), inventories of raw materials and finished goods) and its _(operating) current liabilities_ (due within 12 months; e.g. acconuts payable). It measures a company's _liquidity, operational efficiency, and short-term financial health_.
  - NWC = current assets - current liabilities
  - Current ratio = current assets / current liabilities
- NWC < 0 when current assets < current liabilities
  - temporarily negative NWC indicates: a large outlay, or a substantial increase in its accounts payable due to a large purchase of products and services from its vendors
  - long-period negative NWC indicates: struggling to make ends meet, and have to reply on borrowing or stock issuances (not 'insurance'!) to finance their NWC
- NWC = 0 possibly when a company's current assets are fully funded by current liabilities; it potentially increases investment effectiveness, but also significant risks to a company's financial strength, due to lack of extra current assets that can easily and quickly converted to cash when liabilities become due/excessive il-liquid inventories among current assets.
- NWC > 0 when having enough working capital, ensuring covering short-term liabilities, -> financial strength; but too much NWC in unsold and unused inventories, or un-collected accounts reveivable from past sales, is ineffective way of using resources
  - additional funds parked in inventories or (accounts) receivables are not financed by short-term liabiities but long-term capital -> should be used for longer-term investments for effectiveness-> this is the key to maintain an optimal level of NWC, often 20%-100% of the total current liabilities. \
